[Algo.is](https://algo.is/) - Competitive Programming Courses by [Bjarki Ágúst Guðmundsson](https://github.com/SuprDewd)


Competitive Programmer's Handbook is a new book on competitive programming. The book is available for free here:

https://cses.fi/book.html or https://github.com/pllk/cphb

The book is intended for readers who know the basics of programming but no background on competitive programming is required. In particular, the book covers almost all topics in the IOI syllabus.

Note: the book is still under construction. Resource person - Γιώργος Μιχαήλ
